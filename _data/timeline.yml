  description: The project DESTACOM was conducted by some professors from FACOM-UFMS and aims to teach programming logic and programming to students from public and private schools. The motto is "CS Unplugged," which means "Teaching Computing without a computer." In the first part of the project, students learn the concepts without the need for a computer. Then, a programming language is taught, with Python being the chosen one. Monitors accompany the teachers during classes and assist the students in case of doubts.
