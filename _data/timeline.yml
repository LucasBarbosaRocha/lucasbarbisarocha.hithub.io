  description: I participated in the CS Unplugged project, exploring computer science concepts without the need for a computer. I conducted research on Software Registration, addressing its significance and challenges. Additionally, I served as a monitor in Algoritmos e Programação (Algorithms and Programming) courses, guiding and assisting fellow students. Furthermore, I gained valuable knowledge through configuring the Redmine Ubuntu Server and the installation/maintenance of the Rocks Cluster. These experiences significantly contributed to my academic and professional development.
