# DevBook

This Golang project was developed as a result of the course available at https://www.udemy.com/course/aprenda-golang-do-zero-desenvolva-uma-aplicacao-completa/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING.

It consists of two main components:

1. Dev-book-api: An API that allows performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for users and posts, similar to Twitter.
2. Dev-book-application-web: A web application that consumes the Dev-book-api. It simulates a Twitter-like page where users can register, make text posts, like other posts, follow other users, and view posts.

For more details, you can access the source code on GitHub:

- Dev-book-application-web: https://github.com/lucas-lb-rocha/dev-book-application-web
