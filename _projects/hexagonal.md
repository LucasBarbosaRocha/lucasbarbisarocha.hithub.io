# DevBook

This spring boot project was developed as a result of the course available at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/arquitetura-hexagonal-ou-ports-and-adapters-na-pratica/).

This is an example of a hexagonal design. The focus is only on the project structure and how files are created in this architecture.
