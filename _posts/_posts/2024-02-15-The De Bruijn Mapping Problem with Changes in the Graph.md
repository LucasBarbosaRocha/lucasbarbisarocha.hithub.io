# The De Bruijn Mapping Problem with Changes in the Graph

In computational biology, mapping a sequence s onto a sequence graph G is a significant challenge. One possible approach to addressing this problem is to identify a walk p in G that spells a sequence
which is most similar to s. This problem is known as the Graph Sequence Mapping Problem (GSMP). In this paper, we study an alternative problem
formulation, namely the De Bruijn Graph Sequence Mapping Problem (BSMP). We focused on addressing the problem involving changes in the
graph. We reformulated the problem, taking into account the characteristics of the arcs induced in the De Bruijn graph. This reformulation led
to a modification in the problem definition, allowing the application of a polynomial-time algorithm for its resolution.
